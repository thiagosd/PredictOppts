Initial CSV file: 38647 Opportunities.

Data cleanup steps:
1) Remove Test Oppts: 34
2) Remove 'Estimated Value' outliers: 81
3) Remove 'Estimated Close Date' putliers: 2
Total Oppts: 38530
4) Replace 'NULL' with empty space
5) ~5K Oppts mass imported on 05/07/2010. Some were retroactive, causing wrong dates. Removed on code.

Data enhancement:
1) 244 Open Oppts have 'Actual Close Date' value. CRM bug ?
2) Set 'Market' value for 12 Oppts. Got value from 'Created By' user.
